Defined-Length-Series-Creator
=============================

Defined Length Series Creator is an extremely basic program that is used to quickly generate uniform length number series. It allows you to set a starting and ending point, a step value, and the length of the text series. (leading zeroes are used for padding)   Created by Craig Lotter, June 2006
